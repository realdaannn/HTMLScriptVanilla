# HTMLScriptVanilla
An experimental scripting language for html. Exposes vanilla js to html through a special tag.

<p>HTMLSV (HTMLS-Vanilla) is a scripting language for html written in javascript it runs on the client machine and can be used on a standalone webpage without much overhead. There are limitations on this version, some functions of htmls will not work in vanilla because js has no ability to open files on a client.  Vanilla can be used to template menu items and other repetitive content on web pages, using the \{\} or \(\)js can be injected into the page, and used to output a string of formatted html into the page.  This can let one line of html become many more using a loop, or using complex layouts based on page input or using js objects.  </p>
